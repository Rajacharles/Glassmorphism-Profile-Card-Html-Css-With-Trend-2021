# Glassmorphism-Profile-Card-Html-Css-With-Trend-2021 - HTML5 & CSS3

Glass Morphism Profile Card Trend 2021. This UI element is designed to resemble the feature of smooth glass. The basic idea is to blur the background of the element to give a transparent glassy look. Setting a light transparent background for the element is important. Making the background blur gives a layered effect. You can give a frosted glass feel by increasing the blur effect, giving it more depth. 

Great!! We now know the design aspects we need to make a good UI with glassmorphism. We will now use HTML and CSS to build a basic implementation of this new UI trend.
